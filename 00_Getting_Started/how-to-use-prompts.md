## 🤔 What is a "Prompt"?

A **prompt** is simply a set of instructions you give to an AI assistant (like ChatGPT). Think of it like giving directions to a helpful tutor — the better your instructions, the better help you'll receive!

**Example:**
- ❌ Weak prompt: "Teach me German"
- ✅ Strong prompt: "Act as my German A1 tutor. Teach me 10 common greetings with pronunciation tips and example sentences."

This library contains **ready-made strong prompts** so you don't have to create them yourself!

Let's try a simple example. Copy this prompt and paste it into ChatGPT:

```
You are a friendly German teacher for complete beginners. 

Teach me how to introduce myself in German. Include:
1. Three ways to say "My name is..."
2. How to say "Nice to meet you"
3. How to ask "What's your name?"

For each phrase:
- Write it in German
- Write the pronunciation in simple English sounds
- Give the English translation

Keep it simple and encouraging. After teaching, quiz me with 3 easy questions.
```

**What the AI will do:**
- Teach you self-introduction phrases
- Show you how to pronounce them
- Quiz you to practice!

## ⏱️ Study Sessions: The 25-Minute Rule

We recommend studying in **25-minute focused blocks**:

```
⏱️ Recommended Study Session:
┌────────────────────────────┐
│ 25 min │ Study with AI     │
│  5 min │ Take a break      │

## 💡 Tips for Better Learning

### 1. Speak Out Loud! 🗣️
Even when alone, say the German words and sentences out loud. This helps with:
- Pronunciation
- Memory
- Confidence

### 2. Make Mistakes Freely ❌✅
The AI won't judge you! Making mistakes is how you learn. Ask the AI:
> "Correct my German and explain what I did wrong"

### 3. Ask Follow-up Questions 🙋
If you don't understand something, just ask:
> "Can you explain that more simply?"
> "Give me more examples"
> "How do I pronounce that?"

### 4. Practice Daily 📅
- 25 minutes daily = Better than 3 hours once a week
- Consistency is key!

### 5. Track Your Progress 📊
Use the templates in `09_Progress_Tracking/` to see how far you've come.

### "The AI gave me a different response than the example"
That's normal! AI responses vary slightly each time. The core teaching will be the same.

You can modify any prompt! Just add:
> "Make this easier, I'm a complete beginner"

Ask for help:

### "Which AI should I use?"
All of them work well! Try:
- **ChatGPT** — Best overall experience
- **Claude** — Great for conversations
