## 📝 Example Conversation

**You:** [Paste the prompt with GRAMMAR_TOPIC = "der/die/das (German articles)"]

**AI:**

## 📚 WHAT IS IT?
In German, every noun has a gender: masculine (der), feminine (die), or neuter (das). Unlike English where we just say "the," Germans use different words depending on the gender. You need to memorize the gender with each new noun!

## 🤔 WHY DO WE NEED IT?
1. Germans will understand you better if you use correct articles
2. The article affects other words in the sentence (adjectives, pronouns)

## 📖 THE RULE
| Gender | Article | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Masculine | der | der Mann (the man) |
| Feminine | die | die Frau (the woman) |
| Neuter | das | das Kind (the child) |
| Plural (all) | die | die Kinder (the children) |

**Memory tips:**
- Male people/animals → usually der
- Female people/animals → usually die
- Words ending in -ung, -heit, -keit → die
- Words ending in -chen, -lein → das

## ✅ EXAMPLES
1. **Der** Hund ist groß. (The dog is big.) - masculine
2. **Die** Katze schläft. (The cat is sleeping.) - feminine
3. **Das** Buch ist interessant. (The book is interesting.) - neuter
4. **Die** Bücher sind neu. (The books are new.) - plural
5. **Der** Kaffee ist heiß. (The coffee is hot.) - masculine

## ❌ COMMON MISTAKES
- ❌ Wrong: Die Mann ist nett.
- ✅ Correct: **Der** Mann ist nett.
- 💡 Why: "Mann" is masculine, so use "der"

- ❌ Wrong: Das Frau arbeitet.
- ✅ Correct: **Die** Frau arbeitet.
- 💡 Why: "Frau" is feminine, so use "die"

## 📝 PRACTICE TIME!
1. Fill in: _____ Apfel ist rot. (The apple is red.) [Hint: der Apfel]
2. Choose: (Der/Die/Das) Mädchen spielt. [Hint: girl = das Mädchen]
3. Correct: "Die Buch ist gut."
4. Translate: "The house is small." [Hint: das Haus]
5. Complete: Der Tisch ist braun. _____ Lampe ist weiß.
