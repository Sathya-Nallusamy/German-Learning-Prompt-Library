## 📝 Example Conversation

**You:** [Paste the prompt with WRITING_TOPIC = "my daily routine"]

**AI:**

### STEP 1 - PREPARATION

**📚 Useful Vocabulary:**
1. aufstehen - to get up
2. frühstücken - to have breakfast
3. arbeiten - to work
4. essen - to eat
5. schlafen gehen - to go to sleep

**💬 Helpful Phrases:**
1. "Um [Zeit] Uhr..." - At [time] o'clock...
2. "Zuerst... dann... danach..." - First... then... after that...
3. "Jeden Tag..." - Every day...

**📐 Grammar Tip:**
In German, the verb is always in the second position. If you start with a time expression, the verb comes right after: "Um 7 Uhr **stehe** ich **auf**."

### STEP 2 - WRITING PROMPT

**Your Task:** Write about your typical morning routine.

Include:
- What time you wake up
- What you eat for breakfast
- One activity you do before work/school

**Word count:** 30-50 words

---

**You:** 
Jeden Tag ich aufstehe um 7 Uhr. Ich trinke Kaffe und esse Brot mit Butter. Dann ich dusche und ziehe mich an. Um 8.30 Uhr ich gehe zur Arbeit. Ich mag nicht der Morgen.

---

**AI:**

### STEP 3 - FEEDBACK

📊 **OVERALL SCORE:** 7/10

✅ **WHAT YOU DID WELL:**
- Great use of time expressions (um 7 Uhr, Um 8.30 Uhr)
- Good vocabulary for daily routine
- Clear structure from morning to leaving for work

❌ **CORRECTIONS:**

| # | ❌ Your Version | ✅ Correct Version | 💡 Why |
|---|----------------|-------------------|--------|
| 1 | "Jeden Tag ich aufstehe" | "Jeden Tag **stehe ich auf**" | Verb must be in position 2, and "aufstehen" separates |
| 2 | "Kaffe" | "**Kaffee**" | Spelling: double 'f' and double 'e' |
| 3 | "Dann ich dusche" | "Dann **dusche ich**" | After "dann", verb comes before subject |
| 4 | "ich gehe zur Arbeit" | "**gehe ich** zur Arbeit" | After time expression, verb before subject |
| 5 | "Ich mag nicht der Morgen" | "Ich mag **den Morgen nicht**" | "mögen" takes Akkusativ (den), "nicht" goes at end |

📝 **IMPROVED VERSION:**

"Jeden Tag stehe ich um 7 Uhr auf. Ich trinke Kaffee und esse Brot mit Butter. Dann dusche ich und ziehe mich an. Um 8.30 Uhr gehe ich zur Arbeit. Ich mag den Morgen nicht."

💡 **TIPS FOR NEXT TIME:**
1. Remember: In German, the verb is always in the SECOND position. After time words like "dann", "zuerst", or time expressions, the verb comes before "ich".
2. Double-check spelling of common words like "Kaffee" (two f's, two e's)

🌟 **BONUS CHALLENGE:**
Instead of "Ich mag den Morgen nicht," try: "Der Morgen ist nicht meine Lieblingszeit!" (The morning is not my favorite time!) — sounds more natural and interesting!
